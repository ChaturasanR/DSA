/**
 * The legendary Farmer John is throwing a huge party, and animals from all over
 * the world are hanging out at his house. His guests are hungry, so he
 * instructs his cow Bessie to bring out the snacks! Moo!
 * 
 * There are A snacks flavors, numbered with integers 1,2,â€¦,A. Bessie has A
 * snacks, one snack of each flavor. There are M guests and every guest has
 * exactly two favorite flavors. The procedure for eating snacks will go as
 * follows:
 * 
 * First, Bessie will line up the guests in some way.
 * Each guest in their turn will eat all remaining snacks of their favorite
 * flavor. In case no favorite flavors are present when a guest goes up, they
 * become very sad.
 * Help Bessie to minimize the number of sad guests by lining the guests in an
 * optimal way.
 * 
 * Solution:
 * 1. Consider snacks as nodes and the animals as edges
 * 2. If there is no cycle we can arrange the animals such that each get atleast
 * one snack
 * 3. So the number of sad guests = minimum edges needed to remove so that the
 * graph becomes acyclic
 * 4. Since it is undirected graph we can use DSU to check for how many edges it
 * leads to a cycle formation
 * 
 * T.C: O(V + E), S.C: O(V)
