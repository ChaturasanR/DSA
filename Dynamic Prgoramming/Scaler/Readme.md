# Dynamic Programming

## Important steps to consider for DP
- Optimal substructure: The problem should be able to solve using recursions
- Overlapping subproblems: And if there are repetitive subproblems

## Problem Solving using DP
- There are two formats of DP
    - Memoization (top-down approach): Easy to modify the recursion. But takes up space for recursive stack
    - Tabular (bottom-up approach): Specific efficient but slightly harder to get this format
- For solving DP problems below things need to be kept in mind
    - DP state: Assumption what it needs to store
    - DP Expression: Main logic
    - Base case
