# Trees

## Binary Tree Traversals
- InOrder
    - Traverse left subtree
    - Visit the node
    - Traverse right subtree
    - DFS traversal

- PreOrder
    - Visit the node
    - Traverse left subtree
    - Traverse right subtree
    - DFS traversal

- PostOrder
    - Traverse left subtree
    - Traverse right subtree
    - Visit the node
    - DFS traversal
- LevelOrder
    - Traverse level by level
    - Uses Queue
    - BFS Traversal

## Binary Tree Types
- Full
    - 0/2 children
- Complete
    - Every node has either 0/2 children
    - All levels are filled up except for the last level (exception)
    - In last level the nodes are filled from left to right
- Perfect
    - All levels are completely filled up
