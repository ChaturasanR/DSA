/**
 * Problem: There is a row of seats represented by string A. Assume that it
 * contains N seats adjacent to each other.
 * There is a group of people who are already seated in that row randomly. i.e.
 * some are sitting together & some are scattered.
 * An occupied seat is marked with a character 'x' and an unoccupied seat is
 * marked with a dot ('.')
 * Now your target is to make the whole group sit together i.e. next to each
 * other, without having any vacant seat between them in such a way that the
 * total number of hops or jumps to move them should be minimum.
 * In one jump a person can move to the adjacent seat (if available).
 * NOTE: 1. Return your answer modulo 10^7 + 3.
 * 
 * Solution:
 * From the observation, we can think of sliding window technique.
 * Find the total number of people (K) and store their positions in array
 * We need to apply sliding window technique with window size K and count the
 * hops by calculating difference between the position in the window and the
 * person position
 * Take the minimum for all those differences
 * T.C: O(N*K), S.C: O(K)
 * If we write the problem in mathematical equal it is equivalent to minimize
 * |ai- x|.
 * The given equation is minimum when x divides aâ€™s into two equal groups. So x
 * is median
 * So to solve the problem
 * First median of the seats that people has currently occupied
 * Then with respect to median calculate the hops required first from left side
 * and then from right side
 *
